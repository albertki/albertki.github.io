  <h2>Music</h2>
    <span id="quote">“We can never write every key, we can never touch every single song
      in the key of life, but we can, at the least, in the time that we are
      given in life, do the best that we can do.” - Stevie Wonder</span>

  <h2>Movies</h2>
    <div class="external-link">
    <p>There are some movies that you just <em>can't</em> stop rewatching, whether it's
      because of a catchy line, funny/memorable scene, or simply, great acting/
      filmmaking. The movies don't necessarily have to win an oscar to be good.
      If it's entertaining, then it's what I consider a good movie. Personally,
      great movies tend to last in my head somehow–a particular scene/quote, it's
      overall tone/mood, unique plot/characters, an insanely hot actress. <em>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/?ref_=ttls_li_i">
      The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</a></em> and <em>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264464/?ref_=ttls_li_i">
      Catch Me If You Can (2002)</a></em> remains one of few movies that regardless
      of how many times I rewatch the entire movie, it never ceases to captivate me.
      It's one of the movies I really don't skim through but start from the
      beginning every time I rewatch it.</p>
    <p>I've recently gotten into watching movies and tv that deal with law and lawyers and all that. So far,
      they were one of the better movies that I had seen especially when it comes to drama.
      I like how movies like <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117913/?ref_=ttls_li_i">
      A Time to Kill (1996)</em></a>, <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106918/?ref_=ttls_li_i">
      The Firm (1993)</em></a>, <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107818/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2">
      Philadelphia (1993)</a></em> dramaticize court proceedings and cases
      which make it all the more compelling as tension in the court elevates.
      <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/?ref_=ttls_li_i">
      The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</a></em> was one that I had come across the movie poster
      as well as the title from time to time, but it was just one of those "hidden gem" movies
      that I never really gave any thought about until one day I randomly decided to watch it and
      found the plot and acting to be rather entertaining. The plot and overall mood
      was unique, dark and all that-apparently it's part of a Swedish novel series, yet
      I think it's somewhat unfortunate that the sequel adaptation will feature a different cast.</p>
    <p>In a different light, I'm also a fan of comedies, including what I
      consider the better Adam Sandler movies like Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, Anger Management,
      Click, Just Go With It. My all time favorite is, however, still Mrs. Doubtfire, which remains a childhood
      favorite. Then there's ones like Rush Hour series, Horrible Bosses series, Hangover, Step Brothers,
      School of Rock, Napoleon Dynamite (both childhood favorites)...Come to think about it,
      Napoleon Dynamite, a rather indie movie, is jam packed with so many hilarious/
      memorable lines and scenes that make it so legendary as a comedy, with its
      own share of creativity and the unique, maybe avant-garde atomosphere it brings to the plate.</p>
    <p>Then there's the animated/cartoon movies that are actually decent-Toy Story, Shrek,
      Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, How to Train Your Dragon (1), and Heavy Metal, which
      I wish they would have made more of.
