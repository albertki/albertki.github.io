  <h2>Favorite Quotes</h2>
    <p>Here's some food for thought. To feel smarter than I truly am, I have
      been collecting my favorite quotes/maxims that I often muse and mull over
       and try to manifest in my daily life. Themes encompassing inspiration,
      friendship, philsophy, plain life, authored by thinkers, artists, writers,
      and leaders, past and present. </p>
